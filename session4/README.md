# task 
This week our task is extremely simple: use the bellow repository and provided guideline to setup a K8S cluster:  
https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way  
The task itself is simple, yes but doing it is hard; hence “the hard way” in the repository name :)  
Try to absorb as many information as possible on how these services are being sets up.  
Hint 1: This guideline is based on GCP; you have to change any related part to adapt it accordingly. Search a little bit and use “baremetal” keyword; use this result just as guideline and refer to our own link to do the task.  
Hint 2: Don’t try to fully understand what’s going on; try to understand as much as possible only about the cluster and deliver the task in exact time frame.
